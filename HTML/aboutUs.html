                <span>Review from Homeadvisor</span>
                <p>"We could not be more pleased with t squared! We had an amazing experience with T-Squared construction. Our finished basement is stunning, and it's clear they paid great attention to detail in their work. We had our basement finished including a bedroom, a full bathroom, a gym, and a movie room. They worked so efficiently and were always prompt, working every single weekday until our basement was complete. I have heard horror stories about contractors who show up once every few weeks, so finishing a basement can take months and months or simply never get finished at all! I was shocked every day after they left when I would go down and check on their work because there was always so much progress! They finished our basement in the schedule outlined at the beginning of the project and I'm aware that it very unusual for stuff like this. They were so delightful and pleasant to work withâ I was kind of sad when our basement was done because it was so great to work with them! But obviously Iâ m happy to have a beautiful brand new basement! We ran into very few issues, but anytime there was one, they promptly fixed it for us, no questions asked. They were very responsive to texts and answered all of our questions any time of the day. The price was good considering how crazy construction is right now in Utah. I canâ t say enough good things about T-Squared and would definitely use them again in the future!"</p>

               <span>Review from Homeadvisor</span>
               <p>"On time, charged exactly as quoted, nice people, good quality work. Tyler and crew finished our basement (bedroom and bathroom), added a backsplash to our kitchen and added an accent wall to two bedrooms (one in slate and one in barn wood). Everything turned very nicely. They were working a few projects at the time, but they were very good about telling us when they would and would not be there. The accent walls were particularly tricky and turned out really nice. I would use them again."</p>

They finished our basement for us and we love the finished product. They communicated with us along each step of the process. We will definitely be reaching out to them when we are ready for another project."</p>

               <p>"I will recommend T Squared to everyone asking for contractors in the future. Tim and Tyler are friendly, professional, responsive, and trustworthy. Their team is very respectful and cognizant of the separation between work space and family space. Their pricing was great, and their approach to the project is collaborative. They really are everything you are looking for in a contractor. I would absolutely hire them again without question."</p>

               <span>Review from Homeadvisor</span>
               <p>"These guys are amazing. We finished our entire basement so they were at my house pretty much every day for 3.5 months. They were prompt, clean, and worked really hard! I had heard scary stories about contractors and this was the first major construction project I had ever undertaken, so I was nervous. Tim was thorough in his estimate, and communicated clearly all along the way, making sure I understood anything that was outside of the estimate. As a result, no surprises, no big overages, and we finished IN BUDGET!! Tyler was our foreman and he communicated almost daily on what progress was made and what would be done the next day. At one point we went out of town during the project and they sent us pictures everyday to show us the progress. I never had an unanswered phone call or text (even when I butt dialed). I can honestly say I was sad at the end of the project, which was within a week of our projected date, because I enjoyed working with them so much. I was not sad, however, to have my beautiful new basement. The quality of work was superior, and I even joked that they were pickier than I was. I couldn't be happier with their job performance. Well done, T-Squared!"</p>

               <p>"Tim and Tyler (and the rest of the crew) were very responsive throughout the whole process. We are happy with the job and would consider them first for any other remodeling jobs for our home. Price is of course important, but not to the exclusion of the "right fit." T-squared was the right fit for our family and we are glad to have come to know them."</p>
